# Automatic Alignment of Heliostats
It is our aim to measure alignment deviations of solar power tower heliostats in real-time and use these deviations to align the heliostats with a greater accuracy than existing methods.

## To do
* Prepare control logic for RPi
* Break socket handling down to simple API for just sending messages from PC to RPi
* Review data structure for video processing e.g rolling buffer, windowing, etc
