# Automatic Alignment of Heliostats
It is our aim to measure alignment deviations of solar power tower heliostats in real-time and use these deviations to align the heliostats with a greater accuracy than existing methods.

## To do
* Create udp sockets in module_controller
* Simulate communications between python and C++ sockets on the same host
* Break socket handling down to simple API for just sending messages from PC to RPi
